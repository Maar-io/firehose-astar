### StreamingFast Firehose Astar Types

Protobuf definitions when dealing with Firehose Astar chain(s) like Astar Mainnet and Astar Testnet.

Foremost, this provides [sf.astar.types.v1.Block](https://buf.build/streamingfast/firehose-astar/docs/main:sf.astar.type.v1#sf.astar.type.v1.Block) which is used for consuming Firehose & Substreams Astar block model.

This is probably the only model you should really care about, the rest are meant for internal communications for Firehose operators.
