### StreamingFast Firehose Acme Types

Protobuf definitions when dealing with Firehose Acme chain(s) like Acme Mainnet and Acme Testnet.

Foremost, this provides [sf.acme.types.v1.Block](https://buf.build/streamingfast/firehose-acme/docs/main:sf.acme.type.v1#sf.acme.type.v1.Block) which is used for consuming Firehose & Substreams Acme block model.

This is probably the only model you should really care about, the rest are meant for internal communications for Firehose operators.
